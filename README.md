The com_webcomand_noisemeter_www folder is a [webCOMAND Package](https://www.webcomand.com/docs/api/php/io_comand_package/) that must be installed on a [webCOMAND server](https://www.webcomand.com/signup/) in order to work because it utilizes the [COMAND PHP API](https://www.webcomand.com/docs/api/php/) for the MVC Framework, Email Templates, to send emails and connect to the Base ("cloud database").
